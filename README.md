# DataAnalysis
This is the final paper in my data analysis course, Autumn 2015. The grade I got is A.

**[Abstract]** Financial income is the basic guarantee for a country's government to realize the function of the government, and the tax is the main component of the financial revenue. The growth of tax revenue and the development of a country's economy and social progress are closely related. China's tax is mainly impacted by the national economic development and other factors, in particular the GDP. In this paper, we establish a mathematical model for the impact of tax, and use Excel, MATLAB and R to analyze the time series data collected by the regression analysis. Moreover, eliminate the problem of the existence of simple multiple regression model, establish a more accurate model, analyze the main factors affecting the tax and its influence, and finally get the piecewise linear relationship between tax and gross domestic product. Then we set up a trend growth model, and forecast the growth trend of China's tax revenue and GDP.
